# QGAI — Tasks (priority order)

> Always sorted by priority. P1 = do first. Full detail/history → WORKING_NOTES.md + FIXES_CHANGELOG4.md.
> **DECISION (2026-06-26): confirm all ideas on the CURRENT period first. Full-history is PARKED until then.**
>
> **▶ NEXT PRIORITY (2026-06-29, Anisa+Claude): edge is proven (regime-TP beats global on full-history**
> **AND WFO OOS). The remaining unknowns before scaling REAL money are DRAWDOWN + operational safety —**
> **NOT more edge-validation. Order: (1) P2b — measure real 3% drawdown ($10k sim; fixed-lot DD 1.7% is**
> **NOT the real figure, could be ~28-39%); (2) finish L8 safety + watch the L8 bug-fix holds on demo;**
> **(3) run demo 1-2 weeks on the locked config; (4) then scale real money small (consider risk 1-2% if**
> **DD high). PARK research (L2 A/B, more TP/buffer sweeps, ADX/news studies) until live is stable — don't**
> **add variables mid-validation. Global WFO re-run = optional/low-priority (regime already wins). DO LATER.**

| **Signal↔Trade DECOUPLE** | Imtiyaz architecture: signal = pure engine (BUY/SELL/SKIP) દરેક bar, backtest જેવું; trade execution ને signal સાથે કોઈ સંબંધ નહીં; account ના હોય તોય signal બંધ ન થાય | `bridge_main.py` 11 log_signal sites હવે real `signal` + નવો `trade_action=` (EXECUTED/EXEC_FAILED/HOLD_IN_TRADE/BLOCK_*/MONITOR/NO_TRADE...). `bridge_data.py` નવો `trade_action` column (CSV+SQLite+migration). 78.59%→SKIP bug fixed → હવે signal=BUY, trade_action=HOLD_IN_TRADE. Test: `Test_Decouple_Signal.bat` **10/10 PASS** (offline, live files untouched). Trade-logic UNCHANGED. Dashboard SIGNAL LOG માં `trade_action` colored badge ઉમેર્યો (EXECUTED/HOLD_IN_TRADE/BLOCK_*/EXEC_FAILED...). **NEXT: bridge + dashboard restart કરી activate કરવું.** |
| **Decision area = છેલ્લો BUY/SELL signal** | Imtiyaz: signal box + AI summary + Market Intelligence માં latest SKIP bar નહીં પણ **છેલ્લો પડેલો signal** (BUY/SELL) એના દરેક param સાથે દેખાય | Backend `bridge_dashboard.py`: `_remember_last_trade_signal()` cache (persist `logs/last_trade_signal.json`, restart-safe); `write_dashboard` line ~508 પર `sig` ને છેલ્લા BUY/SELL થી freeze — આખો decision block (prob/market_structure/ev_r/risk_grade/ai_summary/market_intel) એમાંથી derive થાય એટલે coherent. Live price/session/countdown `tick` માંથી → live રહે. Cached signal પર `signal_confirmed=True` + નવો `signal_is_cached` flag. Frontend `dashboard.html`: 🕒 last @ HH:MM hint. **Activation: bridge restart (backend).** |
| **SIGNAL LOG win% dim on SKIP** | Imtiyaz: SKIP row પર win% gold ના દેખાય, SKIP-text જેવો dim | `dashboard.html _liveSigRender`: gold ફક્ત BUY/SELL ≥45% પર. Browser refresh. |
| **SIGNAL LOG: virtual entry→exit→move દરેક BUY/SELL પર** | Imtiyaz: log માં દરેક buy/sell નો price move (દા.ત. 4076→4100 = +$24) દેખાવો જોઈએ — trade પડ્યો હોય કે ના — અને exit price calc દેખાય | Root: exit calc પહેલેથી છે (`shadow_ledger.py` દરેક signal ને live exit rules થી paper-trade કરી entry/exit/R/pnl કાઢે; scheduler દર 15min refresh; 821 signals). ખૂટતું હતું display. Fix (**dashboard-only, engine untouched**): `dashboard.html _liveSigRender()` હવે દરેક BUY/SELL પર shadow માંથી inline `4076.00→4100.00 +$24.00 +2.5R TPᵛ` (green/red, dashed) બતાવે — trade પડે કે ના પડે. Real trade close થયો હોય તો extra `WIN/LOSS +$move REAL` solid chip અલગ. **Activation: dashboard browser hard-refresh (bridge restart જરૂરી નથી).** |

| **ADX-death exit** | Imtiyaz idea + Fable-5 design: K/4 TF ADX slopes ≤0 for N bars + profit ≥ X×R → exit | Code DONE (`config.py` + `backtest_replay.py`). Default OFF. Bats: `Run_ADXDeath_TEST.bat` (2-week smoke) + `Run_ADXDeath_Sweep.bat` (18-cell K×N×X). **NEXT: run TEST bat, then sweep, then WFO top-2.** |
| **PART 2 composite REJECTED** | 10 raw ADX → 5 tanh composites | WFO +405.6R vs +444.7R = −39R. Higher AUC but lower R → "accuracy ≠ profit." Bats DELETED. |
| **max_open=2 REJECTED** | User caught R-unit measurement artifact | Fixed-lot 0.01×2 = double risk. Dollar return at 3% total: max_open=1 beats max_open=2 (6.85M% vs 4.95M%). 95% same-direction overlap = correlated bet. |
| **Volume-exit DEAD** | Non-monotonic, tautological, broker tick_volume = noise | Conditional table: within each ADX-death bucket, volume adds nothing. Permanently closed. |
| **TP-sweep in-sample** | Wider TPs win: Rng2.8/Trn1.4/Vol1.0 | In-sample done. WFO validation pending (do AFTER ADX-death). |

| # | Task (કામ) | પરિણામ |
|---|------------|--------|
| **CTF-OFF** | `skip_counter_trend_fade` True→False (LIVE) | Path-A live-parity BT: CTF-OFF **+384.5R vs +350.2R = +34.3R (+9.8%)**, WR +0.4pp, PF +0.20. CTF blocked 0/3-aligned 77%-WR edge. Reversible: `QGAI_CTF_FADE=1`. |
| **Feature PART 1** | drop 6 dead EA-combo features (41→35) + retrain | Static full BT first gave **+393.4R**; weekly-retrained WFO then gave **+444.7R = +51.3R (+13.0%) lift**, 51/53 positive weeks, worst -0.4R. New honest WFO baseline = +444.7R. |
| **FAB-S4** | vSL persistence (`vsl_persist.py`) | trailed vSL survives restart (was reset to entry). Verified live 4× (4119→4142). Broker SL 3×→1.5×. |
| **FAB-S3** | live DD brake (`dd_brake.py`) PER-ACCOUNT | dd>10%→½/20%→¼/30%→halt. Enabled live. **Bugfix same-day:** global peak poisoned mirror accounts → per-account (login-keyed) fix. |
| **FAB-S1** | reversal-entry gating (flag, default OFF) | reversal re-entry passes filter stack when `gate_reversal_entries=True`. |
| **FAB-S2** | news staleness check (`news_updater.py`) | startup banner if calendar stale; was false-positive (file OK through Dec 2026). |
| **FAB-H6/H8/H9** | replay-ADX as-of · checkpoint sig env+mtimes · ADX-gate live-wire | parity/integrity fixes (details FIXES_CHANGELOG4). |

| **Dashboard** | config badges + Account-Health/Risk-State panels + Signal-log rebuild | per-account fill status, DD band, vSL $ risk, daily-SL headroom (Fable-5 review). `Rebuild_SignalLog.bat`. |
| **Master launcher** | `Start/0_START_ALL.bat` | one-click cold-start (data+chart+shadow+signal-log+bridge+dashboard, minimized). Training deliberately EXCLUDED (stays `3_Train_Models.bat`). |
| **Model-mismatch** | fixed (composite→raw restore) | PART 2 composite retrain + env-leak caused live train/serve skew; restored validated raw-36 (`_backup_part1_raw35`). Verified match. |

NOT the feared 28-39%. Raw/un-braked (cross-week DD-brake not applied → live brake keeps it lower). Caveat: every OOS month positive = optimistic; assumes backtest fills=live, real slippage/news can deepen it. → 3% DD-tolerable; watch actual DD on demo. Script: scratchpad/oos_dd.py. |

| # | Task | સ્થિતિ |
|---|------|--------|
| **P3'** | DEMO forward-test (relabel+HTF+regime-TP, 3%) | ચાલે છે — **real proof** |
| **L2** | REBUILT trainset A/B | **model backup થઈ ગયું ✅**, full-history પછી run |
| **ET1** | **Entry-timing redesign — trend-following pullback entry (ATR-free)** | **v2 GENERATE built + promising; SWEEP pending.** Live = baseline (both flags **False**, dormant, reversible — NO live change). Design → [`docs/ENTRY_TIMING_REDESIGN.md`](ENTRY_TIMING_REDESIGN.md). **v1 BLOCK** (filter ML entries) → Sweep-A TEST: no combo beat baseline (block only REMOVES trades, cut winners) → parked. **v2 GENERATE** (the real fix — `trend_pullback_generate()`: CREATE an early entry when ML SKIPs but dominant HTF ADX trend pulls back to the ratchet line, so we enter early not at the top). Shared `_pullback_ok()` conditions (live+backtest parity), config `trend_pullback_generate`/env `QGAI_PB_GEN`, `run_wfo.py --sweep-pb-gen`, bats `Run_PBGenSweep_AsOf_TEST/_FULL.bat`. **GEN TEST sweep (2 wk) = REJECT: all 7 combos byte-identical to baseline** (+12.8R/14tr wk-set). Diagnosed (not a bug): generate FIRES (96 signals, features populate) but `max_open=1` → generate's pullback signals land while a trade is already open → 0 net new trades; clean same-flag smoke changed only Ranging +0.6R (noise). GEN value only materialises when the bot is FLAT during an aligned pullback (the rare 02-03 Jul case) — too rare to move total R here. **PARKED (nil impact under max_open=1).** Both flags OFF, live=baseline, reversible. FULL gen sweep NOT worth running (would be identical). To revisit: allow >1 position, or gate GEN to only fire when flat + ML would otherwise SKIP-then-late-enter. **Pivot → FIX-3 (live≠backtest) = the real scaling blocker.** |

### ✅ થઈ ગયું (DONE — 2026-06-30 / 2026-07-01)
| # | Task | પરિણામ |
|---|------|--------|
| FF-RM | **REMOVE flip-fix / hysteresis code** (Divyesh, 2026-07-02) | DONE. Rejected on PROFIT grounds — every clean-parity test showed hysteresis LOWERED total R: June sweeps (−6.5/−7.2/−9.9R), yesterday 07-01 (+4.08R→+1.26R), and **WFO true-OOS full year: baseline +360.1R vs hyst +314.2R = −45.9R (−12.7%)** despite dir_flips −75% (726→183) and flat WR/PF. It blocks profitable flips (esp. Trending). Removed from `config.py` (hysteresis_margin field), `bridge_main.py` (pick block), `backtest_replay.py` (env FF block + `import os as _os`); deleted helper scripts `flipfix_*.py` + all `Run_FlipFix_*.bat`. Result folders + BUFFER_015_BacktestVsWFO / BUFFER_FLIPFIX_WORKFLOW reports kept as record. Live = clean baseline max-prob pick (restart to load). |
| L5 | Buffer sweep (global) — `Run_Buffer_Sweep.bat` 0.10/0.15/0.20/0.25/0.30%, 1yr, 42-feat+forming-line+regime-TP, fixed-lot 0.01 | Ran 2026-06-30 (`backtest/results/bufsweep/buf_0.*.txt`). **0.15 best balance: PF 3.87, +430.70% net, Max DD 2.9%** (vs 0.20: PF lower, DD similar). **APPLIED to live 2026-07-01** — `config.py ratchet_buf_pct: 0.20→0.15` (reversible, old value in comment). ⚠️ Regime-wise breakdown (best buffer PER Ranging/Trending/Volatile) not yet done — global sweep only; regime-adaptive buffer still open if wanted later. |
| Bug | **win_prob frozen 75+ min live (12:15→13:30) — inference.py silent stale-feed** | Imtiyaz flagged (WinProb stuck at 27%). Traced via `logs/signals_all.csv`: win_prob/state_prob/dir_prob/hmm_state bit-identical across 6 bars while price moved — `get_signal()`'s OHLC-merge staleness-guard silently failed to refresh `self.ohlc_df`, and the failure path was a bare `print()` invisible in `bridge.log`. **FIXED:** merge failures now also `log.error(...)`; added a `_ohlc_stale_bars` counter that alarms in bridge.log after 2 consecutive bars with no fresh candle merged. Needs bridge restart to load; not yet live-verified. |
| Live | **🔴 vSL close failed, retcode 10027 (AutoTrading disabled)** | Imtiyaz's live log showed both primary (VantageDemo) and secondary (VantageCentLive #29453256, REAL money) close orders rejected with 10027 = MT5 terminal AutoTrading OFF. **Not a code bug** — told Imtiyaz to enable AutoTrading in the MT5 terminal immediately (stops aren't actually protective until then). Recommend (not yet built): an explicit alert (not just an `[ERROR]` log line) when any close fails. |
| Bug | **Mojibake emoji in console (`ðŸ’“` etc.)** | `Start\1-5` bats never set `PYTHONUTF8=1`/`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` (unlike `6_Shadow_Ledger`/`7_Refresh_Chart`/all backtest bats) → Windows console fell back to legacy codepage. Display-only, no logic impact. **FIXED:** added both env-vars to all 5 `Start\*.bat`. Takes effect on next restart of each. |
| Check | **"Did Codex break something today?" (Imtiyaz asked)** | Audited every file with a 2026-07-01 mtime (`bridge_main.py`, `bridge_data.py`, `chart_data.py`, `chart_live_ohlc.py`, `config.py`, `backtest_replay.py`, `shadow_ledger.py`) — all compile clean, no unexplained/undocumented changes found. The win_prob-freeze bug traces to `inference.py` (not touched today) and the 10027 error is an MT5 terminal setting, not code. **No evidence of a Codex-introduced mistake.** |
| Dash | **dashboard.html fixes (Imtiyaz's own edits, Claude-verified)** | Duplicate `id="sig_history_chart"` (dead bottom panel) removed; mojibake header fixed; missing "MODEL" confidence box restored (`conf_model_val`). Verified: 0 duplicate IDs, div-balanced, JS syntax clean. |
| Fmt | **Win-prob / all-% displays → 2 decimals everywhere** | ~35 spots across `dashboard.html`, `inference.py`, `bridge_main.py`, `bridge_dashboard.py`, `chart_data.py`, `signals.html`, `shadow.html`, `QGAI_Live_Panel.html` changed from `.0%`/`.1%`/`toFixed(0)`/`toFixed(1)` → `.2%`/`toFixed(2)`, for every probability/rate/gauge % (win_prob, state/dir prob, win rate, slot WR, daily-loss/eq gauges, regime distribution, etc). Left non-% numbers (prices, $ amounts, R-values, spread pts, SVG coords, hours-ago) untouched. |
| Feat | **Stuck-trade manual-protect (Imtiyaz's spec, 2026-07-01) — ENABLED** | New: `bridge_session._close_position()` tracks consecutive close-failures per ticket (`_CLOSE_FAIL_COUNTS`). Past `stuck_close_fail_threshold` (default 3) it logs a loud repeating `🚨 STUCK` alert every retry (was: one `[ERROR]` line, easy to miss — this is what happened with #1519547791 today, retcode 10027 AutoTrading-off). `stuck_trade_hedge_enabled=True` (Imtiyaz turned it on 2026-07-01) — opens a protective opposite-direction hedge to freeze further P&L movement while the close keeps retrying; auto-unwinds once the original close finally succeeds. **Bug caught + fixed before it could bite:** first draft reused L13's `manual_hedge_magic` (202699) — but `bridge_manual.py`'s cleanup sweeps/closes EVERY position on that magic whenever its OWN floor/vSL/TP fires (magic-only filter, no comment check), which would've silently closed a stuck-trade's protective hedge out from under it the next time a manual trade's floor/vSL/TP happened to fire. **Fixed:** stuck-trade hedges now use a brand-new dedicated `stuck_hedge_magic` (202698), fully isolated from L13's pool — confirmed via code read (`bridge_manual.py _positions()` only matches its own magic). Bot keeps the ORIGINAL trade's own magic (202600) — MT5 doesn't allow re-tagging an existing position's magic, so "treat as manual" is a code-level bookkeeping flag only, confirmed OK with Imtiyaz. ⚠️ Not yet DEMO-verified end-to-end (places a real order) — watch the first time it actually fires. |
| Bug | **vSL recovery fallback = hardcoded $15 guess, disconnected from real ratchet** (Imtiyaz flagged: leftover #1519547791 vSL showed 4016.42, doesn't match H1 line ~3975) | Traced via `bridge.log`: real vSL at open was 4012.35, trailed once to **4015.11** (22:30). Comments are a clean brand-tag by design (no embedded VSL/SL) and this trade has no broker-side SL (pure-virtual design) → `recover_open_trades()` fallback (`bridge_core.py`) hits `broker_sl_dist=0` → hardcoded `sl_dist=15.0` → `entry−15.0=4016.42`, matching the observed value exactly (bug confirmed, not coincidence). **Root cause of why it kept resetting:** separately found `_close_position()` callers in `bridge_core.py` were doing `del self.virtual_trades[ticket]` **unconditionally** after every close attempt — even on FAILURE — so the moment a close failed once, the trade silently dropped out of live vSL monitoring for the rest of that session (contradicting the "bot will keep retrying every check" alert text) and only ever got picked back up via `recover_open_trades()`'s lossy fallback on the next restart (08:30/09:25/15:21 today). **FIXED (2026-07-01):** `_close_position()` now returns True/False (True = confirmed closed); all 5 call sites in `bridge_core.py` only `del` the VirtualTrade on True — a failed close now correctly keeps retrying every tick with the REAL vSL intact, no restart needed. Real vSL-persistence-across-restart (so recovery never needs to guess) still NOT done — lower priority now that the trade stays tracked live without restarting. |
| Bug | **bridge_main.py heartbeat log — mojibake heart emoji (Imtiyaz's spec: fix ONLY this, nothing else)** | Imtiyaz flagged one broken heart emoji in the heartbeat log line (`💓 heartbeat — ...`, the one Codex apparently introduced). Investigating turned up ~680 MORE mojibake instances throughout the rest of the file's log messages (pre-existing, unrelated) — a full-file sweep was done first, but Imtiyaz clarified he only wanted the ONE heartbeat-line instance touched, not the rest. **Reverted the full sweep**, re-applied the fix to ONLY `bridge_main.py:334-335` (the `_hb_state` string + the `log.info(f"💓 heartbeat — ...")` line) — verified via scan that these are the ONLY 2 lines in the file using clean (non-mojibake) emoji/dash chars now; everything else intentionally left as before. `py_compile` clean. |
| Feat | **backtest_replay.py checkpoint/resume (Imtiyaz's spec, 2026-07-01)** | `_checkpoint_pkl` existed but was dead/unused code (no save or load anywhere) — a stopped/interrupted backtest lost ALL progress, had to restart from bar 0. **Built:** saves state (equity, open trades, trades/signals so far, daily-loss tracking) every 500 bars AND on Ctrl+C (flag-checked at the next bar boundary, not exception-based, so it can't corrupt a half-written record). Checkpoint is keyed by a full config signature (date range, risk%, buffer%, TP-regime, all ratchet/filter flags) — a checkpoint is ONLY ever reused for the byte-for-byte SAME config, same paranoia as the WFO-cache Bug H precedent (never silently resume into a mismatched run). New `--no-resume` flag forces a clean restart. Auto-deletes the checkpoint on successful completion. Confirmed the engine has no cross-bar online-learning state in replay mode (no `.fit()`/partial_fit calls found), so skipping already-done bars on resume is behaviorally identical to a full run. ⚠️ Could not get an automated `py_compile` check this session (bash sandbox mount stuck serving a 3+ hour stale cached copy of the file, confirmed via `stat` mtime — known documented issue) — verified instead via full manual line-by-line Read-tool review of every edited section + docstring-balance check. Should be spot-checked on the NEXT backtest run (current running full-year backtest is unaffected — already loaded the old code into memory). |
| Bug | **backtest_replay.py console looked frozen/blank during long runs** | Imtiyaz flagged the console showing nothing for long stretches. Root cause: `sys.stdout`/`stderr` were wrapped in a plain `io.TextIOWrapper` (no `line_buffering`), so `print()` output sat in Python's internal buffer and only flushed once it filled or the process exited — a long backtest LOOKED stuck even while working correctly. **FIXED:** added `line_buffering=True` to both wrappers + `flush=True` on the progress print, progress interval tightened 500→100 bars (with a running % complete), and `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` added to both `Run_Live_Buffer_015_CSV.bat`/`_TEST.bat` as a belt-and-suspenders fix for Windows console pipe buffering. |
| Feat | **Graduated stuck-trade excess-hedge, 3%→6% risk stretch (Imtiyaz's idea, 2026-07-01) — built, OFF by default** | New `bridge_session._stuck_risk_hedge()`: instead of freezing the FULL lot the instant a stuck trade's close fails (old `_place_stuck_hedge`, still available), let risk stretch from `risk_pct` (3%) up to `leftover_risk_cap_pct` (6%, new config) and hedge ONLY the excess lot once **unprotected slippage** (price moved past the trade's REAL vSL — passed in from the live `VirtualTrade`, not reconstructed — while close keeps failing) pushes risk past that stretched band; tops up incrementally if slippage keeps growing, never exceeds `pos.volume`. Reuses L13's `_contract_size`/excess-hedge math pattern (`bridge_manual.py`). Gated by new `leftover_excess_hedge_enabled` (default **False**) — takes priority over `stuck_trade_hedge_enabled`'s full-lot hedge when ON. Depends on the retry-loop fix above (needs the trade to stay live-tracked to keep re-evaluating). ⚠️ Not yet enabled or tested — Imtiyaz to confirm before flipping the flag. |

| L1b | Full-history **GLOBAL vs REGIME** TP compare (2022→2026, HTF+CTF, 0.01 lot) | **Regime wins:** PF 2.35→**2.47**, WR 59.2→**59.9%**, Total **+676→+708R**, same DD 1.7%, ~47/50 months green incl. unseen 2022-24. Results: `results/signal_log_full` (global) vs `results/fullhistory_regime` (regime). |
| P3✓ | regime-TP confirmed LIVE-wired | `ratchet_tp_regime=True` (config) + `bridge_core.py:170`. Rng 2.0/Trn 1.0/Vol 0.8. |
| 🔴 L8-bug | **balance-flow FALSE daily-SL halt** (Anisa flagged via live log) | FIXED: `_net_balance_flow_today` used LOCAL time → counted LIFETIME deposits ($906k) as today → equity looked $68k → halt all day. Now broker-time filter + 50% safety guard. (BUG_LOG 06-29.) |
| Bug | **offline-closed trades blank in signal log** | FIXED: `preload` now calls `write_outcome` → backfills WIN/LOSS for trades closed while bridge OFF. |
| Bug | signal-log **duplicate rows** (same bar 2-3×) | FIXED: dedupe guard in `log_signal` (one row/bar+mode); 44 dup rows cleaned. |
| L9 | **Complete signal log** (full-history backtest + live, $ move) | `build_signal_log.py` rewritten → merges regime full-history (every bar, move) + live → `logs/signals_complete.csv` (97,322 bars). Dashboard reads it (history+live merged, live overrides). Bat: `Run_BuildSignalLog.bat`. |
| L11 | startup **gap-backfill** (overnight signals → dashboard) | `_overnight_replay` now logs missing bars (mode=BACKFILL) → dashboard shows overnight history. Resume-prompt was already built (config-gated). |
| Dash | **signal log overhaul** | one complete log (date+time sorted, price, win%, regime, H4-RANGE, BW%, lot, WIN/LOSS REAL, $ move, equity, reason). Removed dup Signal-History table + SLOT DISCOVERY panel; kept chart. equity/move columns added to `log_signal`. |
| L13 | **Manual-trade Manager** (Anisa spec) | BUILT + ENABLED on DEMO (`bridge_manual.py`, config-gated). **Final design (approach A, combined vSL):** combines ALL manual trades (magic 0) into ONE net position (sum lots, vol-weighted avg entry) → ONE **ratcheting vSL** on the 2-SMMA line (HTF/H1), trailed as a **VISIBLE broker SL on every leg**; breach → close ALL; **SEPARATE 3% risk pool** (`manual_risk_pct=3`, independent of bot's `risk_pct=3` → 3%+3%=6% total) broker-SL backstop + **excess-hedge** if combined lot > 3%-equiv; **target-TP** (`manual_target_tp_pct=2%`) → close all; flip-hedge REMOVED (vSL handles reversal). L8-isolates manual P&L from the bot's daily ratchet. Bot entry-guard counts only magic 202600 → manual trade does NOT block a same-direction system trade (room to trade). **DEMO (primary) only** — cent extension rejected (would conflict with mirror-trading). Config: `manual_manager_enabled=True` (demo test). Verified live: detects existing trades, sets 3% SL + vSL. |
| Cfg | accounts | Added **Vantage CENT LIVE 29453256** (secondary, XAUUSD.pc, pass to fill); **disabled TradeQuo 125926628**. |
| L11+ | **Resume-prompt — REMOVED (Anisa, 06-30)** | Built + enabled, but it fired on the first NEW bar (loop), not the exact startup moment → felt like "asking while running." Anisa removed it: `resume_prompt_on_start=False`. Reason: the bot now MANAGES manual trades, so the user just opens a trade manually when wanted (bot handles it) — no need to ask the bot to take a signal. Bot auto-trades its own signals. Code stays (config-gated off). |
| Feat | **Feature removals + RETRAIN** | (1) `ts_line_dist_pct` removed (was rank #2). (2) `vol_spike` removed completely. Retrained 23:22 → **44→43 features**. AUC **0.6791→0.6881** (held); SELL test AUC **0.7557** (WR 67%). HTF-align importance jumped (h4_h1_regime_score 0→0.0329, h4_trending_h1_aligned #2) — model now weighs HTF trend. ⚠️ **run WFO** before trusting live. REVERT: delete `_MANUAL_PRUNE` line + restore vol_spike + retrain. |
| EMA200 | **EMA200 S/R / exit / entry — INVESTIGATED, no change** | M15 EMA200 = decent short-term S/R (~80% bounce/2h). Exit/tighten → cuts winners (R −12%) ❌. Cross → no reversal edge ❌. Hard entry filter → misses big moves (Anisa declined) ❌. KEY: "SELL below EMA" = worst (39.5% win) = bottom-chasing confirmed. Keep EMA200 as SOFT model features (already in the 43). |
| L7b | **Vestigial code remove — DONE** | dead `bridge_risk` (PBE/partial/BE/smart-exit) removed; **ATR removed completely** (safe-subset + rest, bot stopped): bridge_main atr20_pct compute, inference vol_regime→constant + move-model fixed 0.2, train_move_model fixed 0.2, dashboard labels. ADX-internal atr14 kept (indicator math). SQLite/CSV `atr20_pct` column LEFT nullable (logs 0 — drop = migration risk). |
| Dash | **Stale TP/SL/ATR labels FIXED** (Anisa flagged) | header TP→regime cap, SL→Ratchet, ATR(info) removed; `atr_mult` dropped from backend. `dashboard.html`+`bridge_dashboard.py`, 0 nulls. |
| BugChk | **4-round bug-check (Anisa, 06-30)** | Found + fixed the only real issue: **stale RUNNING CONFIG display** — printed PARTIAL/TRAIL/BE/SMART-EXIT + "TP cap 1.0%"/"maxrisk 1.2%" as active, but those are removed (L7b) / regime-TP+HTF actually used. Now shows pure-ratchet + regime-TP + HTF-forming + %·line buffer. (bridge_main.py:233-249). Feature count OK (41+hmm=42). No functional bug. Minor edges noted: manual vSL not persisted on restart; manual buf fixed-vs-%·line. |
| Manual-vSL | **Manual SL → PURE VIRTUAL + indicator-match (Anisa, 06-30)** | No broker SL on the terminal (don't expose the stop to the market). bridge_manual: removed all `_set_sl` calls; vSL tracked internally + logged `🔼 [VIRTUAL]`; bot closes ALL on breach (vSL/floor) — tracked like the bot's own trades, combined. **Buffer now = 0.20%·LIVE line** (was fixed avg·0.20%) → fully matches the chart indicator + bot. Line uses forming H1 (via get_htf_state). Floor stays entry-based (risk cap). ⚠️ bot OFF = no protection (explicit). 0 nulls, verified. Restart to apply. |
| L13-fix | Manual mgr **line-independent floor-breach close** | bridge_manual.py:157-169 — before `if line:`, if price past the 3% floor → close ALL manual + hedges (🔻). Enforces the cap even when the ratchet line is unavailable. Read-verified, 0 nulls. Effect on restart. |
| EMA200-cut | **Keep ONLY price_vs_ema200** (Anisa, 06-30) | Removed `ema200_dist_abs` (rank-37) + `above_ema200` + `near_ema200` via `_MANUAL_PRUNE` + cleaned computations/loops; `price_vs_ema200` kept. **RETRAINED 2026-06-30 10:17 → 42 features** (verified: price_vs_ema200 in, 3 out). AUC **0.6881→0.6807** (tiny drop, still > original 0.6791). Bot restart-safe (42-feat). re-WFO pending. |
| WFO✓ | **43-feat retrain OOS VALIDATED → KEEP** | 2026-06-30 `wfo_results` (global-TP): **+255.4R / 41 wks / 38 green (93%) / +6.23R-wk / maxDD −3.0R**. OLD 44-feat regime-TP +266.2R (global≈global). AUC 0.6791→0.6881. ts_line_dist_pct + vol_spike removal = **harmless**, model held → KEEP. Optional `Run_WFO_TPREGIME.bat` for exact regime match. |
| vSL-parity | **backtest_replay parity for vSL change** | 2026-06-30: backtest now matches live — forming-H1-line (vf=bar-open when `ratchet_htf_forming`, lookahead-safe) + trail buffer = 0.20%·line. Trade carries `ratchet_buf_pct`. 0 nulls, Read-verified. → WFO/backtest now faithful to live config. |
| vSL-live | **vSL trails the LIVE H1 line + %-buffer** (Anisa, 06-30) | (1) `ratchet_htf_forming=True` — uses the FORMING (current) H1 bar's line = matches the chart indicator's live value (3979.55, not last-closed 3988.03) → no hourly lag, less profit give-back. `bridge_ratchet.get_htf_state` includes the forming bar + skips the cache. (2) trail buffer now = **0.20%·line recomputed per bar** (bridge_risk:105), not fixed-$-from-entry. ENABLED on demo. ⚠️ backtest parity + WFO pending (see REMAINING vSL-parity) before real money. |
| Bugs | **A · F · B · E resolved; C still open (corrected 2026-07-01)** | A (secondaries flatten on daily-SL) ✅ · F (backtest_replay HTF config-aware) ✅ · E (UTF-8 wrapper) ✅ · B ✅ (open_time reconstructed on restart — still used by `bridge_dashboard.py:259` for elapsed-time display, NOT moot) · **C still 🔶 open** (SYMBOL not refreshed after failover; dormant since MT5_PRIMARIES unset — was wrongly marked N/A here). **D open** (subprocess refactor, being investigated 2026-07-01) — M fixed, see below. |
| M | **Bug M fixed (2026-07-01)** | `run_wfo.py --trail-mode` default changed `"line"` → `None`; forward guard changed to `if args.trail_mode is not None`. No flag → follows `backtest_replay.py`'s own config-aware default (htf today, matches live) same as before, now correct-by-design not accidental. Explicit `--trail-mode line` now genuinely forces literal M15-line mode (previously silently ignored and ran htf instead). `py_compile` clean. |

### ✅ થઈ ગયું (DONE — 2026-07-02/03: HMM v3 + audit FIX-1)
| # | Task | પરિણામ |
|---|------|--------|
| HMM-DI | **HMM "Volatile" mislabel — v3 `rel` DEPLOYED (2026-07-03)** | 3 variants A/B'd WFO-gated: spec reject (degenerate 92% Trending), leak-world rel +481.7R ≈ baseline; **honest (as-of) A/B: legacy +407.6R vs rel +393.7R = tie (paired t=−0.69), rel DD −26% (5.2R vs 7.0R) + 0 negative weeks → Divyesh chose rel.** Deploy verify: **ALL CHECKS PASSED** — flat 07-02 window 18 Ranging/4 Trending/**0 Volatile**, stability train≈full (45/35/20). Bonus: honest data પર hmm_state importance 0→0.0305 (#6). Revert: `_backup_pre_hmm_v3` + `.bak_preasof_20260703_104235`. |
| FIX-1 | **Audit Fix 1 — intra-bar HTF lookahead leak REMOVED (2026-07-03)** | `regen_adx_asof.py` (as-of = live-updater semantics, validated err=0.0) **APPLIED** to adx_merged; `mt5_data_updater.py` also as-of convention (future updates consistent). Leak drift measured: M30 mean 0.28/max 12.8, H1 0.45/11.5, H4 0.58/10.1 ADX pts (M15=0 ✓ sanity). Leak-inflation ~15-18% પુષ્ટિ (483→408 legacy). **નવો HONEST baseline = wfo_asof_rel +393.7R** — હવે પછીની દરેક સરખામણી આની સામે; જૂના +483.1R/+481.7R આંકડા retired. |

### 🟡 બાકી (REMAINING — parked / pending)

#### ▶ TOP NEXT (2026-07-07, priority order — Fable-5 ranked)
| # | Task | વિગત |
|---|------|------|
| **RAW-VOL retrain** (2026-07-09, Imtiyaz) | `tick_volume` raw feature ઉમેર્યું → RETRAIN + WFO-gate | Code DONE: `"tick_volume"` (raw MT5 tick count, no normalization) `features.py` FEATURE_COLS માં ઉમેર્યું (~line 1183); normalized `"volume"` pruned જ રહે. **TEST-bat PASSED (2026-07-09):** `Start/3_Train_Models_TEST.bat` → 5/5 checks ✓ (36 features, tick_volume idx 25, matrix built 120×36 no crash, values RAW 1554–8957 range, mean 5175 — clearly not the old 0–5 ratio). No model written, live `.pkl` untouched. **NOT LIVE — live .pkl માં column નથી → feature-mismatch.** NEXT: `Start/3_Backup_Models_BEFORE_Retrain.bat` (safety) → `Start/3_Train_Models.bat` full retrain → deep bug-check → **WFO-gate ≥ current baseline R (+444.7R)** પહેલાં live adopt. raw volume noise ઉમેરી શકે; model importance≈0 કાઢે એ પણ માન્ય પરિણામ. REVERT: FEATURE_COLS માંથી `"tick_volume"` line કાઢો. |
| ~~**PART 2 decision**~~ ❌ REJECTED 2026-07-07 | ADX 10-raw → 5-composite consolidation | **FULL WFO = +405.6R vs +444.7R = −39R (−8.8%). FAILED the gate.** Composite lost per-TF info the raw features carry (AUC 0.705 was higher but total R lower — accuracy≠profit). 52/53 positive weeks (good stability) couldn't offset the R loss. Fable P≈30% correct. **DECISION: keep PART-1 raw-36 (live). Never set `QGAI_ADX_MODE=composite`.** `adx_fs_div` late-entry lever was alive but didn't save total R. Composite model discarded. |
| **FIX-3 parity** (Fable's #1, REDEFINED 2026-07-08) | backtest↔bridge_core EXIT-logic parity | Reversal-close TESTED = not the gap (overlap 13.6→15.2%). The "12% overlap" is a SHADOW-ENGINE ARTIFACT — `shadow_ledger.py` has no max_open (154 entries → 44 when locked, vs backtest 66). **+444.7R is trustworthy (pessimistic if anything — backtest under-trails 0.6R/trade).** NEXT: code-diff `bridge_core.py` (live truth) trail/flip/TP vs `backtest_replay.py`, make backtest match live exactly, re-run. Key Q: does live trail unconditionally or regime-gated? Drop shadow-overlap as a metric. Keep demo running (final entry-side arbiter). |
| **max_open=2** (only path to +50% goal) | 2 concurrent positions | Research +347R in-sample but 2× exposure/DD → needs dynamic-risk demo validation AFTER FIX-3. Not a switch-flip. |
| **Goal reality** | +20-50% R (target +420-525R) | PART-1 already banked +13% (+444.7R WFO). No single safe lever reaches +50%; only max_open=2 does, and only responsibly after FIX-3. Honest ceiling without it ≈ +10-15%. |

#### 🚨 Fable-5 SYSTEM AUDIT 2026-07-07 — 16 findings (fix after Path A backtest)

**SEVERE (live-critical — Path A પછી તરત):**
| # | Task | વિગત |
|---|------|------|
| ~~**FAB-S1**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 (flag-gated, default OFF) — reversal re-entry now passes full filter stack when `gate_reversal_entries=True`; close-on-opposite backtest port still pending (see M12). | 🚨 **Live reversal path bypasses all entry filters + backtest doesn't model reversal** | `bridge_main.py:500-509` opposite-signal handler bધા range/CTF/pullback/SMMA blocks પહેલાં ચાલે. `bridge_core.py:543-601` `handle_opposite_signal` → `execute()` direct, zero filter check. Backtest માં reversal code છે જ નહીં. **સૌથી મોટું FIX-3 12%-overlap gap explanation.** Fix: (a) reversal path ને same gate stack માંથી પસાર કરો, અથવા (b) `handle_opposite_signal` નું backtest port કરો; દરેક reversal separately log કરો measurement માટે. |
| ~~**FAB-S2**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 (FALSE POSITIVE + defensive check installed) | 🚨 **News calendar DEAD 2026-05-15 થી (~7 weeks silent)** | `news_all_2024_to_now_pure_cleaned.csv` last event = May 15. **કોઈ auto-updater નથી.** `mins_to_next_3star=240` (pegged), `is_pre_news`/`is_post_news=0` હંમેશા → pre-news +0.05 threshold bump OFF, news-model routing OFF. Bot NFP/CPI માં 0.42 Volatile threshold પર trade કરે. Feature-distribution drift (training vs live) પણ silent. Fix: automated weekly calendar pull + startup/hourly staleness assertion ("newest future event < now → ERROR banner + optional trading pause"). |
| ~~**FAB-S3**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 (`engine/dd_brake.py` NEW + `calc_lot` wired; config `enable_live_dd_brake` default OFF — turn ON for real capital) | 🚨 **DD brake live code માં EXISTS નથી** | `grep dd_brake` → માત્ર `backtest_replay.py:471,937` hit. Live risk = per-trade 3% + daily 9% only; NO peak-equity tracking anywhere. `TASKS.md` P2b's "live brake keeps it lower" = **false**. Multi-day losing streak = full 3%/trade indefinitely compound. P2b's 14.6% DD lower bound only. Fix: `bridge_core.execute()` / `calc_lot()` માં peak-equity tracking + 10/20/30% scaler implement. |
| ~~**FAB-S4**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 | 🚨 **Disaster SL = 3× vSL + restart trailed stop entry-level પર reset** | `bridge_core.py:215/221` broker_sl = vSL_dist × 3.0. `bridge_core.py:626-637` recovery regex `VSL=` શોધે, પણ comment હવે "QuantEdge AI | {phase}" (line 224-225) → **હંમેશા fallback broker_sl/3 = entry-level vSL**. `pos.sl==0` તો invents `sl_dist=15.0`. Restart while +2R trailing → vSL entry પર snap back → locked profit ગુમ; bridge death → માત્ર 3×-wide broker SL. Fix: per-ticket vSL state SQLite માં persist કરો, restart પર restore; broker SL ≤1.5× tighten કરો. |
| **FAB-S5** ⏸️ DEFERRED (profit tradeoff — do NOT silently flip) | 🚨 **HTF forming-bar line/flip: live ≠ backtest (root of TRAIL 49% vs 11%)** | Live `bridge_ratchet.py:96-106` FORMING H1 bar જુએ (flip appears/vanishes intra-hour, M15 close પર evaluate). Backtest `backtest_replay.py:339-353` COMPLETED bar mapping (flip bar-open થી known — mild lookahead, line stable). Live unconfirmed forming flips પર exit; backtest confirmed flips પર "hour early" exit. Entry SL sizing પણ diverge. Config comment પોતે "needs backtest parity + WFO before live" કહેતો હતો — never done. Fix: true forming-line replay build કરો (H1 SMMA per M15 sub-bar recompute) OR `ratchet_htf_forming=False` set કરો till parity proven. |

**HIGH (data integrity / parity):**
| # | Task | વિગત |
|---|------|------|
| ~~**FAB-H6**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 — `get_live_adx()` now truncates history to `bar_dt` (true as-of); overnight replay passes `bar_dt` per bar. | Overnight replay TODAY's ADX past bars માં inject કરે → BACKFILL rows lookahead-tainted | `bridge_main.py:677` `get_live_adx(50)` without `bar_dt`; `inference.py:640-641` replayed timestamp stamp કરે, merge કરે. BACKFILL rows in `signals_all.csv` + shadow ledger lookahead-tainted. FIX-3 shadow −1.9R metric partly ledger પર rest કરે. Fix: `bar_dt` per replayed bar pass કરો OR replay દરમિયાન ADX merge skip; `mode=BACKFILL` rows metrics માંથી exclude. |
| **FAB-H7** ⏸️ DEFERRED (backtest-side; would shift +350.2R baseline → flag-gate before enabling) | Daily-SL semantics live≠backtest | Live `bridge_core.py:378-391` `check_daily_sl_intrabar` — floating equity પર halt + force-close all. Backtest `backtest_replay.py:454-474` `daily_stopped=True` — only new entries block, open trades ride on; equity update only at trade close → floating DD trip નહીં થાય. Fix: backtest_replay માં mark-to-market equity per bar simulate + force-close at floor. |
| ~~**FAB-H8**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 — `_resume_sig` now folds `sorted(QGAI_* env)` + model .pkl mtimes. Env-toggle / retrain forces fresh run. | Backtest checkpoint resume signature env vars + model mtimes omit કરે | `backtest_replay.py:276-283` `_resume_sig` — `QGAI_CTF_FADE`, `QGAI_SKIP_RANGE`, `QGAI_RANGE_MIN_PROB`, `QGAI_PB_*`, `QGAI_ED_*`, `QGAI_HMM_VARIANT`, model pkl mtimes omit. Env toggle change / model retrain → same CLI re-run → half-old/half-new resume = plausible-wrong results (WFO-cache class bug, Bug-H ghost). Fix: signature માં `sorted(os.environ QGAI_*)` + model file hashes fold કરો. |
| ~~**FAB-H9**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 — `adx_strength_soft_block` + combined SMMA+ADX cap wired into `bridge_main` (dormant, default OFF) → live==backtest if ever enabled. | ADX-strength gate + combined SMMA+ADX cap backtest only, live માં નથી | `backtest_replay.py:619-635` `adx_strength_soft_block` call + combined-penalty cap; `bridge_main.py` બંને missing. `adx_strength_soft=True` OR `QGAI_ADX_STRENGTH=1` adopt થાય એ દિવસે live behavior WFO winner match ના કરે — structural parity break guaranteed. Fix: identical block `bridge_main` માં wire કરો (dormant behind same flag). |

**MEDIUM (behavior / cleanup):**
| # | Task | વિગત |
|---|------|------|
| **FAB-M10** ⏸️ DEFERRED (stateful behavior change — needs backtest before live; don't half-implement) | HMM regime zero hysteresis — noise flip threshold 0.48↔0.42 બદલે | Per-bar GMM argmax (`inference.py:712-714, 895-899`) — Ranging→Volatile એક noise bar પર marginal 0.43-prob signal fire કરે. Fix: 2 consecutive bars require OR `predict_proba` margin threshold check before switch. |
| ~~**FAB-M11**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 — picker now prefers any actionable BUY/SELL over higher-prob SKIP; mirrored in backtest for parity. | Best-of-BUY/SELL picker higher-prob SKIP ને lower non-SKIP કરતાં prefer કરી શકે (**prime directive violation**) | `bridge_main.py:445` picker win_prob comparison — SKIP result higher prob હોય તો select થાય, જ્યારે opposite direction lower-prob non-SKIP હોય. Trades silently lost. Fix: any non-SKIP ને SKIP કરતાં prefer કરો. |
| ~~**FAB-M12**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 — parity-gap table written to `docs/FILTERS_MASTER.md` §PARITY GAPS (7 gaps, status each). `manual_risk_pct=6.0` footgun noted. | 7 explicit live-only parity gaps List | (1) spread guard, (2) opposite-signal reversal [S-1], (3) manual manager `bridge_manual.py` real orders own 3% pool, (4) stuck-trade hedge magic 202698, (5) forming-H1 line [S-5], (6) DD brake inverse [S-3], (7) daily-SL floating semantics [H-7]. Note: `bridge_manual.py:106` `manual_risk_pct=6.0` default vs line 255 `3.0` — dormant footgun. Manual loss = 9% daily halt trip → bot day stop, backtest ne model નથી. Fix: single reconciliation report table + `manual_risk_pct` default fix. |
| **FAB-M13** 🟡 PARTIAL 2026-07-07 — CTF re-audited via Path A: DISABLED (+34.3R, live config changed). Range-phase re-audit (soften 0.55) tested = flat +2R → kept ON. Both now post-leak-fix validated. | Range-phase + CTF-fade blockers pre-leak-fix evidence પર justified — never re-audited under profit directive | Config comments in-sample numbers (−43R range, +15R CTF) HMM leak-fix + relabel પહેલાં measured. A/B hooks (`--no-range-skip`, `QGAI_CTF_FADE`) exist પણ post-2026-07-03 rerun TASKS માં recorded નથી. **SMMA-gate જેવો risk profile — hard blocks on stale evidence.** Path A આ address કરે છે — post-Path-A verdict લખો. |
| ~~**FAB-M14**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-07 — SMMA comment rewritten "PROVEN HARMFUL, do not flip"; dead session keys (use_time_filter/enable_ny_session/window*/enable_morning_session) marked ⚰️ DEAD + flipped False (0 readers verified). | Config comments accepted findings ને contradict કરે — re-enable trap | `config.py:89-100` SMMA gate "+51R, flip to True after DEMO" સેલ કરે છે જોકે proven −3.7R/PARKED. `use_time_filter=True` + `enable_morning_session`/`enable_ny_session`/`window1_*`/`window2_*` બધા dead (grep zero readers) છતાં live દેખાય. **Future session config.py વાંચી proven-harmful gate re-arm કરી શકે.** Fix: dead keys delete, SMMA comment "PARKED — proven harmful (−3.7R live parity, blocked 33 profitable trades)" કરો. |

**LOW (retrain-cycle cleanup):**
| # | Task | વિગત |
|---|------|------|
| **FAB-L15** | `is_dead_hour` 57-59% WR hours ને dead label કરે | `features.py:611` (comment પોતે admit કરે). Mislabeled feature training માં baked. Retrain cycle પર cleanup candidate. |
| **FAB-L16** | Backtest exit prices spread + slippage ignore કરે | Spread only entry પર charge; exits exact vSL/TP touch પર fill (`SimTrade._close`). Live exits bid/ask + 30s spread-wait entry delay. Small per-trade, systematic 700+ trades over. Fix: exit spread modeling `backtest_replay.py` માં add. |

---

| **EA-TS-REMOVE** | **Remove `ts_adx_switch_trend` feature IF scoring-system adopted** (Imtiyaz, 2026-07-07) | Legacy EA rule (H4 dir if H4_ADX≥19 else H1 dir). Currently used as XGBoost feature (`features.py:1339`) + ratchet trailing already uses fixed H1 (not the switch) + early-entry v2 optionally uses it via `QGAI_ED_HTF_RULE=adx_switch`. **Policy: KEEP as feature TODAY, never as a live decision rule.** **Trigger to remove: if/when a data-tuned SCORING system (SMMA/ADX/other) replaces the EA-19 rule everywhere.** Then: drop from `FEATURE_COLS` (features.py:1183/1255/1339) + retrain models + WFO-gate ≥ baseline. Blocked by: scoring system must first prove real edge (P(worth-it) currently 0.15-0.35 per Fable-5). |
| L2 | REBUILT trainset A/B (12,976 flips, full history) | model experiment — **AFTER current config locked** (buffer-sweep + re-WFO of 42-feat+forming-line+%-buffer first; don't mix variables). REBUILT format ✅ train.py-compatible. Plan: backup 42-feat model → config `trades_file`→REBUILT → retrain → WFO vs +255.4R → keep/restore. |
| L3 | ML Exit/TP-predictor model (13-sweep માંથી) | research |
| L6 | ADX encoding study (level vs +DI/-DI vs slope) | research |
| L12 | News ablation + calendar pipeline fix | research |
| D | Bug D — one-subprocess-per-MT5-terminal refactor (root of multi-account fragility) | **2026-07-01: reviewed with Imtiyaz — design (one primary decides, secondaries mirror as slaves) IS intentional; confirmed no change wanted.** Symptom already mitigated (warm-up fix + primary failover). Stays parked/dormant, revisit only if a new live symptom traces back here. |
| N2 | Run `Run_WFO_LiveMatch_Buf015.bat` (new, 2026-07-01) — walk-forward OOS over the SAME period as `live_buffer_015` (2025-06-29→2026-06-29), buf 0.15 + tp-regime + tp-equity 0 + risk 3 (matches current live config exactly). Needs the user's own machine (real train.py + xgboost/lightgbm/catboost/hmmlearn) — cannot run in Claude's sandbox. Purpose: fair OOS check against `live_buffer_015`'s in-sample PF 4.27 / DD 10.77%. |
| **FIX-2** | **Audit Fix 2 — entry gate cleanup** (updated 2026-07-03 honest-data importances પછી): **(a) feature prune — PARKED (Divyesh):** honest data પર જૂની "10 dead" list ખોટી પડી (hmm_state હવે #6, momentum_aligned_1hr #4!); ફક્ત **2 જ સંપૂર્ણ મરેલી**: `h4_trending_h1_aligned` + `trade_direction` (ત્રણેય models માં 0.0000; direction-માહિતી ts_htf_agreement #2 + momentum_aligned_1hr #4 માં જીવે છે). momentum_aligned_4hr રાખવી (SELL #22, combined #23). Prune = trail sweep પછીના retrain cycle માં, WFO-gate ≥ +393.7R. **(b)** failed SELL move-model retire/regate (ρ=0.25). **(c)** calibration rolling-OOS + threshold sweep 0.35/0.42/0.50 (threshold આંધળો વધારવો નહીં — profit-first). **(d) ACTIVE NEXT: TRAIL sweep** — peak +0.94R → exit −0.15R (1.09R giveback/trade); bats તૈયાર: `Run_TrailSweep_AsOf_TEST.bat` → `Run_TrailSweep_AsOf_FULL.bat` (as-of workdir, demo સાથે parallel-safe), પરિણામ SWEEPASOF_SUMMARY.csv → "trail sweep done" કહેવું. |

## P1 — Retrain model on RELABELED data (current period)
Config `trades_file` → `Back_testing_data_final_cleaned_RELABELED.xlsx` (same Dec24→Apr26 entries,
labels recomputed under live HTF exit — 27% changed). Model still on OLD labels until retrained.
- [ ] Run `Start\3_Train_Models.bat`.
**Revert:** `config.py` `trades_file` → old `Back_testing_data_final_cleaned.xlsx` (one line).

## P2 — WFO OOS validation (confirm relabel + regime-adaptive TP) — on the current period
Gate before any live change. Both need P1 retrain first; run BOTH on the same (relabeled) data.
- [ ] `Run_WFO_FULL.bat` → `wfo_results` (global TP, relabel baseline) — compare PF vs old 1.55.
- [ ] `Run_WFO_TPREGIME.bat` → `wfo_tpregime` (regime-adaptive TP). Compare vs the global baseline.
- [ ] Keep relabel / regime-TP ONLY if each holds OOS (PF, avgR, Total R, green-week %). Else revert.
~1.5–2 hr each, resume-safe. Then tell Claude "WFO done".
**Backtest already WON in-sample:** regime-TP Total R 257.7→310.2 (+20%), PF 2.52→2.56 — now needs OOS proof.

## P2-REDO — Re-run WFO after the Bug F/J HTF fix (🔴 the validation must be redone)
**Why:** `backtest_replay` was fixed so backtest HTF = live HTF (config-aware default + H1 flip + H1 entry SL,
BUG_LOG #F/#J). The previous WFO +321R/PF3.28 used `stop-trail=line` (M15 trail/flip) — a DIFFERENT strategy
than live. So that number is INVALID. Must re-run to get the true HTF-matched OOS validation.
**Steps:**
- [ ] Archive the stale HTF-mismatched results (`wfo_results`, `wfo_tpregime`, `signal_log_full`, any run made
      before 2026-06-27 code fix) → `results/_archive/WRONG_*` (don't trust their numbers).
- [ ] Clear the results-dir (Bug H cache won't auto-invalidate) then re-run `Run_WFO_FULL.bat`
      (now config-aware → HTF automatically) + `Run_WFO_TPREGIME.bat`.
- [ ] The currently-running full-history backtest is on OLD code (started before the fix) → its output is stale; re-run.
- [ ] Compare the NEW HTF-matched WFO vs old PF 1.55 baseline; re-decide relabel + regime-TP on the CORRECT numbers.
- [ ] THEN P2b ($10k sim) + P3' (DEMO) on the real validated config.
**Status:** code fixed 2026-06-27; runs pending on PC. **Logged:** 2026-06-27.

## P2b — Check real return + DD under 3% DYNAMIC sizing ($10k Stage-2 sim)
**Why:** WFO uses **fixed 0.01 lot** = clean R / honest edge proof (3% dynamic compounding would distort
PF & total-R via compounding + trade-ordering). So WFO answers "is the edge real?", NOT "what does 3% do?".
After P2 confirms the edge, run the $10k 3%-dynamic-compounding sim to see the LIVE-realistic return + drawdown.
- [ ] Run the $10k Stage-2 sim on the OOS trade log (3% dynamic, FAR TP — `--tp-equity 0`, NOT 3; see RULEBOOK).
- [ ] Read off real return + **Max DD** (expect ~28-39% at 3%). Confirm DD is tolerable; 1-2% if not.
- [ ] This is ALSO the only place the daily 9% ratchet rule binds (fixed-lot WFO never triggers it) — verify it.
**Status:** pending P2. **Logged:** 2026-06-27.

## P3 — Wire regime-adaptive TP into the LIVE bridge + DEMO  (only after P2 confirms)
Currently only in `backtest_replay.py --tp-regime`, NOT in the live bridge.
- [ ] Add regime→TP map (Rng 2.0 / Trn 1.0 / Vol 0.8) to `config.py` + bridge exit path
      (`bridge_core.py`/ratchet), switched on HMM state at entry. Reversible flag to fall back to global TP.
- [ ] DEMO forward-test before live.

## LATER — PARKED until the ideas above are confirmed (Imtiyaz's call 2026-06-26)

### L1 — Full-history backtest (2022→2026, honest OOS)
`Run_Backtest_FullHistory.bat` (DONE/ready) — 2 variants (global vs regime-adaptive) over 97k bars.
Tells if the edge holds on the 2022-24 unseen regime. Run AFTER the current-period ideas confirm.

### L2 — REBUILT trainset (full-history entry set) — Option A
`engine/rebuild_trainset.py` (DONE, RAN): every 2-SMMA flip = candidate entry over 2022-2026, labeled
under live exit → `data/Back_testing_trainset_REBUILT.xlsx` (12,976 trades, ~4.6x data, win 36.9%,
stable by year incl. 2022-24). NOT adopted — bigger change (entry universe). After P2, A/B vs RELABELED
via retrain + WFO; keep only if AUC/OOS PF holds or improves. (Reproduce: `Run_Rebuild_Trainset.bat`.)

### L5 — Line + buffer sweep backtest (GLOBAL **and REGIME-WISE**)
**Why:** the ratchet SL/trail = the 2-SMMA **line** ∓ a **buffer** (`ratchet_buf_pct`, currently **0.20** global).
Set once (0.09→0.20: same profit, lower DD). Just like TP, the best buffer is probably **different per HMM
regime** — Volatile likely wants a WIDER buffer (avoid whipsaw), Ranging/Trending maybe tighter. So sweep
buffer GLOBALLY first, then BY REGIME, on the CURRENT (relabeled) model.
**Plan:**
- [ ] **Global buffer sweep:** `backtest_replay.py --ratchet-buf-pct X` for
      X ∈ {0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50} → compare PF / Total R / **Max DD** / whipsaw
      (FLIP/SL counts). Confirm/replace 0.20. (Old tool `backtest/h1_buffer_sweep.py` — adapt.)
- [ ] **REGIME-WISE:** read each sweep report's BY-REGIME block → best buffer per Ranging / Trending /
      Volatile. If they differ meaningfully, build a **regime-adaptive buffer** (same pattern as the
      regime-adaptive TP: a `_BUF_BY_REGIME` map switched on HMM state at entry, config-gated, default OFF).
- [ ] **Line check (optional):** line = SMMA(2). Test SMMA period {2,3} / buffer floor (`ratchet_sl_min_pct` 0.18).
- [ ] Best global/regime buffer that holds → **WFO-validate OOS** → then DEMO. Reversible.
**Note:** small buffer = tight stop (more SL/whipsaw, less give-back); large = looser (rides pullbacks, bigger
losers). Sweet spot balances DD vs capture, and that balance differs by regime. Do AFTER P1-P3 (don't add
variables mid-validation). Pairs naturally with the regime-adaptive TP work.
**Status:** not started. **Logged:** 2026-06-27.

### L6 — ADX representation study (is the ADX level worth it, or use +DI/-DI / slope?)
**Question (Imtiyaz):** the model currently uses the **ADX LEVEL** on 4 TFs (`M15_ADX`, `M30_ADX`, `H1_ADX`,
`H4_ADX`) PLUS direction (`*_DI_diff` = +DI−−DI on each TF), `adx_trend_count`, and slopes (`h4_adx_slope`,
`h1_adx_slope`). Is the raw ADX level pulling its weight, or would **only ADX**, or **+DI/−DI with slope**,
work better? (ADX level = trend STRENGTH, no direction; DI_diff = DIRECTION + strength; slope = is it rising/fading.)
**How (don't guess — ablation decides; importance is per-model, never remove blindly — RULEBOOK):**
- [ ] Baseline = current features. Use the `QGAI_ABLATE="f1,f2"` env hook (`features.py`) to drop a group
      for ONE WFO without touching committed lists. (Old `Run_Ablate_*.bat` are in `backtest/_archive_bats/`.)
- [ ] Variant A — drop the 4 raw `*_ADX` levels, keep DI_diff + slopes → WFO. Does OOS PF/avgR hold or improve?
- [ ] Variant B — drop DI_diff, keep ADX levels → WFO.
- [ ] Variant C — add explicit +DI/−DI separately and/or more slopes (M15/M30) → WFO.
- [ ] Keep a change ONLY if OOS (PF, avgR, green-week%) improves vs baseline. Watch cross-model redistribution
      (a feature 0-importance in SELL can be #1 in BUY).
**Context:** STRATEGY.md already finds **M15_ADX is a top feature** and a useful FILTER (high ADX = late/chasing
entry = worse; low ADX = clean trend = better). So ADX clearly matters — the question is the best ENCODING,
not whether to use it. Do AFTER P1-P3.
**Status:** not started. **Logged:** 2026-06-27.

### L7 — Fix STALE labels / displays across the system (Imtiyaz flagged)
The code/dashboard still SHOW things that no longer match reality after ATR/volume removal, the 44-feature
prune, and the relabel. Misleading (not all bugs, but must be corrected). Known so far — AUDIT for more:
- [ ] `train.py:33` print `"... | 59 Features"` → wrong (now ~44). Make it dynamic (`len(FEATURE_COLS)`).
- [ ] `inference.py:477` comment `"Compute 46 features"` → stale → dynamic/correct.
- [ ] `train.py:243` comment `"full 43 features"` → stale.
- [ ] **Dashboard/log shows `Live ATR20: 0.1594% ($6.49)`** though ATR is NOT used in any decision
      (display-only; ADX keeps its own internal TR). Either REMOVE the ATR readout or label it clearly
      `(display only — not used by the model)`. Same for any other vestigial readout (volume, etc.).
- [ ] **Hybrid feature-set counts** `Ranging=34 | Trending=30 | Volatile=20` (features.py:1364, state-specific
      RANGING/TRENDING/VOLATILE_FEATURES) — verify these lists are current (no pruned features, consistent with
      the 44-feature universe) and that the printed counts are right.
- [ ] **Full sweep:** grep the codebase + dashboard.html for other hardcoded counts / removed-feature labels
      / outdated strings and fix or make dynamic. ("many more like this" — Imtiyaz.)
- [ ] **Dead code / misleading comments (from 2026-06-27 4-round parity check):** in `bridge_risk.py` the
      PBE / partial-close / full-breakeven logic in `_update_buy`/`_update_sell` is UNREACHABLE in ratchet mode
      (`update()` routes to `_update_ratchet` when `self.ratchet`), yet `PARTIAL_CLOSE_ENABLED=True` and the
      line-47 comment says "NO PBE/partial/BE". Remove or clearly gate the dead PBE/partial/BE/smart-exit code so
      it can't confuse future reviews (it's NOT a behavioral bug — just dead + misleading). Smart-exit
      (`_smart_exit_check`, `SMART_CLOSE`, the Bug-B open_time restore) is likewise vestigial in ratchet mode.
**Why it matters:** wrong labels erode trust in the dashboard and mislead future debugging. Low-risk (mostly
display/comments) — do opportunistically, NOT mid-validation. **Status:** not started. **Logged:** 2026-06-27.

### L8 — Deposit/withdrawal-aware equity (Imtiyaz flagged — 🔴 safety + clean signal log)
**Problem:** the bot reads WHOLE-account equity, but the account gets manual **deposits & withdrawals**.
The bridge does NOT detect balance operations (`DEAL_TYPE_BALANCE`), so:
- A **withdrawal** drops equity → looks like a loss → can **FALSELY TRIGGER the daily-SL / 9% ratchet halt** (🔴 safety).
- A **deposit** raises equity → looks like profit → inflates % sizing + raises the daily ratchet floor falsely.
- The **signal-log `equity` column** (and shadow ledger, $10k analysis) jumps on every flow → polluted analysis.
**Good news:** model TRAINING is immune — it learns on R (price/risk), never equity/balance. Verified. So no
"false training"; this is purely a LIVE-equity + logging issue.
**Permanent solution:**
- [ ] Poll MT5 `history_deals_get` for `DEAL_TYPE_BALANCE` deals → maintain `net_external_flow` (deposits +, withdrawals −).
- [ ] **Daily ratchet/sizing:** when a flow occurs intraday, adjust `day_open` + `day_peak_equity` (and the sizing
      base) by the flow amount so deposits/withdrawals never trip the daily halt or distort lot size.
- [ ] **Signal log (permanent fix):** log a flow-adjusted **`trading_equity`** (= equity − cumulative net flow from
      a fixed start) instead of / alongside raw equity; optionally log flow events to their own line. Then the
      equity column reflects TRADING only and analysis is clean across deposits/withdrawals.
- [ ] (related, already known) manual trades on the account also move whole-account equity — same flow-adjusted
      base helps, but the bot still can't tell manual-trade P&L from its own; document the limitation.
**Priority:** the withdrawal→false-halt path is a real safety bug — do this BEFORE scaling live / before relying
on the equity-based daily ratchet with active deposits/withdrawals.
**Status:** ✅ DONE 2026-06-29 (was partial). (1) daily-SL/TP flow-adjust: `_net_balance_flow_today` +
broker-time fix + 50% guard (06-27/06-29). (2) **lot-sizing base** now flow-adjusted: `bridge_core.execute`
sizes off `equity − today's flow − manual_floating` (intraday deposit/withdrawal or manual leg can't distort
lot). (3) **signal-log `trading_equity` column**: `bridge_session.trading_equity()` = equity − net flow since
a fixed anchor (2026-06-29); logged on every live/monitor signal via `log_signal(..., trading_equity=)`;
old CSV auto-migrated (`_ensure_teq_column`). (4) **flow-event logging**: `log_new_balance_ops()` announces
each new deposit/withdrawal once → `logs/balance_flows.csv`. Optional follow-up: surface `trading_equity` on
the dashboard + add the column to `signals_complete.csv`. DEMO-verify. **Logged:** 2026-06-27, done 2026-06-29.

### L9 — ✅ DONE 2026-06-29 (see DONE table) — Complete signal log: EVERY M15 candle, visible offline, with $/% move + win/loss (Imtiyaz)
**Problem:** `logs/signals_all.csv` only has rows for bars the bridge actually ran (3,747 rows over 18 mo —
far short of ~96/day × ~390d ≈ 37k candles). So the dashboard shows gaps when the system was off, and there's
no per-signal **$ move / % move**, and `outcome` (win/loss) is only on executed trades.
**Want:** every M15 candle (all 96/day) shown — BUY / SELL / **SKIP** (+ reason) — with win/loss, **$ move**
and **% move**, viewable even when the bridge is OFF.
**Solution (backfill + keep current):**
- [ ] Backfill script (model needed → runs on PC): replay the model over EVERY M15 bar (backtest_replay already
      emits `backtest_signals.csv` = per-bar BUY/SELL/SKIP + probs + reason + blocked_by). Join each BUY/SELL with
      its exit outcome (from the exit sim / shadow_ledger) to add `win/loss`, **`move_$`**, **`move_%`**.
- [ ] Write a dashboard-ready `logs/signals_complete.csv` (or fill gaps in `signals_all.csv`) covering all candles.
- [ ] Add `move_$` and `move_%` columns to `bridge_data.log_signal` so the LIVE log captures them going forward too.
- [ ] Point `signals.html` / dashboard Signal Log at the complete file (it already reads the CSV, so offline view
      works once the CSV is complete).
- [ ] Schedule the backfill (after `2_Update_Data`, or a scheduled task) so the log stays complete when the bridge is off.
**Note:** ties into L7 (drop/relabel the stale `atr20_pct`/`vol_spike` columns in the log) and L8 (log
flow-adjusted equity). Do together for one clean signal-log pass.
**IMPORTANT clarification (Imtiyaz asked "won't the model fail to learn from old data?"):** NO — the model
does NOT learn from `signals_all.csv`. The batch model trains on COMPLETE OHLC (97,235 bars) + the trades
file; the online model learns from `live_trades.csv`. The signal log is **display/audit only**. So an
incomplete signal log does NOT starve the model. The mechanism for "model learns from EVERY signal across
ALL history" is **L2 (REBUILT trainset)** — every flip-candidate over 2022-2026, labeled. L9 here is purely
about DASHBOARD VISIBILITY. **Status:** not started. **Logged:** 2026-06-27.

### L11 — ✅ DONE 2026-06-29 (gap-backfill + resume-prompt; see DONE table) — Startup gap-backfill + "trade the last signal?" resume prompt (Imtiyaz's spec)
**Goal:** make the system robust to the terminal being off. On startup it backfills every missed signal,
shows them on the dashboard at 0.01 lot, and asks whether to act on the latest one.
**Flow (on `1_Start_Trading.bat` startup, after the data download/update step):**
1. **Backfill the gap:** replay the model over every M15 bar from the last logged signal → the latest closed
   bar. Log EVERY signal (BUY/SELL/SKIP) into the signal log, with outcome + **$/% at 0.01 lot** → dashboard
   shows the complete overnight history (ties to L9).
2. **Resume prompt:** identify the LATEST signal (most recent completed bar). If it's BUY/SELL and still fresh,
   ASK the user (console y/n, or a dashboard button): *"Take a trade on the last signal? [BUY/SELL @ price]"*.
   - **Yes** → execute at the normal **3% risk** sizing.
   - **No** → skip it, continue the live loop waiting for the next new signal.
3. Then carry on with normal live trading.
**⚠️ Key rule:** ONLY the latest/fresh signal is tradeable. All the older overnight signals are **LOG-ONLY**
(record + 0.01-lot P&L for the dashboard) — they cannot be traded because the price has moved on (no trading
the past). This matches Imtiyaz's "trade on the LAST signal" + "overnight signals just update the log".
**Touches:** `bridge_main.py` (startup sequence + the prompt + gap detection), `bridge_data.log_signal`
(backfill writes), dashboard. **Depends on / overlaps:** L9 (complete log), L10 (clean live log).
**Status:** not started. **Logged:** 2026-06-27.

### L12 — News / economic-calendar: prove usefulness (ablation) + fix the data pipeline
**Two parts.** (a) Is news actually adding edge? (b) The data is stale/unused.
**Findings (2026-06-27 check of `Economi calandar data/`):**
- Model uses 2 news features (`mins_to_next_3star`, `mins_since_last_3star`) + a pre-news threshold bump
  in inference. So news IS integrated — but its EDGE is UNTESTED (volume + ATR were both intuitive yet
  failed ablation and were removed; news could be the same or genuinely useful).
- Model's news file `data/news_all_2024_to_now_pure_cleaned.csv` ends **2026-05-15** (~6 wks stale) and starts
  2024-01 (so the 2022-2023 full-history backtest runs with news=0).
- The rich `Economi calandar data/ForexFactory_Calendar_3yr.csv` (2023-06→2026-06, currency/impact/
  forecast/previous/revision, 15k rows) is **UNUSED** by the model. Plus duplicate sources (Neex / vinteg, both 3.9MB).
**Plan:**
- [ ] **Ablation:** drop the news features via `QGAI_ABLATE` → WFO. OOS PF drops → news useful (keep + freshen);
      OOS PF flat/up → news redundant → remove (leaner model). Same method as volume/ATR.
- [ ] If KEEP: fix the pipeline — feed the model from the fresh ForexFactory calendar (refresh on each data
      update), extend coverage back to 2022 if possible, dedupe Neex/vinteg, stop the news file going stale.
**Do AFTER P2-REDO (don't add variables mid-validation).** **Status:** not started. **Logged:** 2026-06-27.

### L13 — ✅ BUILT 2026-06-29 (code done, config-gated default OFF, DEMO-test pending) — Manual-trade MANAGER: alert + auto-manage Imtiyaz's manual trades (Imtiyaz's spec)
**Account = MT5 HEDGING mode (confirmed 2026-06-27)** → opposite positions co-exist (hedge), don't net off.
**Want:** Imtiyaz manually piles onto the bot's BUY/SELL signal for more profit; the system then auto-manages
that manual leg.
**Part A — signal alert:** dashboard "🟢 BUY NOW @ price (win%/regime)" / "🔴 SELL NOW" lights up on a fresh
signal (+ optional sound) so Imtiyaz can open the manual trade. Ties to L9/L11.
**Part B — auto-manage the manual leg (new "manual-trade manager" subsystem):**
- [ ] **Detect** a manual trade (non-bot-MAGIC XAUUSD position; may need a dedicated "manual" tag/magic to
      tell it apart from Anisa's other manual trades).
- [ ] **On manual open → cap effective risk at 6%.** Compute the lot that = 6% account risk for the current
      SL distance (`risk6_lot = equity*6% / (100*sl_dist)`). If the manual lot ≤ risk6_lot → just set a 6% SL.
      If the manual lot > risk6_lot → **immediately HEDGE the EXCESS** (`manual_lot − risk6_lot`, opposite dir)
      so the NET at-risk volume = the 6%-equivalent lot; the excess is neutralised. Manage the net 6% leg with the 6% SL.
      Example: risk6_lot 0.50, manual 0.80 → hedge 0.30 now → net 0.50 at risk; on flip, hedge the remaining 0.50 (full lock).
- [ ] **On the bot's FLIP exit → open a HEDGE** (opposite direction, SAME size) against the manual leg →
      manual net risk = ZERO (P&L locked). Hedging account makes this possible.
- [ ] **On profit → at a TARGET TP (not the daily-equity TP) → close BOTH legs** (manual + its hedge / + bot),
      OR open the hedge against the manual leg to lock it.
**⚠️ Caveats / must-do:**
- Auto-opening hedge positions = real money moves → **DEMO-test heavily** before live; keep a master ON/OFF flag.
- The bot reads WHOLE-account equity → the manual leg's floating P&L can falsely trip the daily 9% ratchet →
  **needs L8 (manual-trade-aware / flow-adjusted equity) FIRST or together** so the bot isolates its own P&L.
- 6% manual SL + the extra leg = much higher total exposure/drawdown (Imtiyaz's choice).
- Define precisely which position is "the manual trade" (tag/magic) to avoid managing the wrong one.
**Status:** not started — design captured. **Logged:** 2026-06-27. **Depends on:** L8 (safety/equity), L9/L11.

### L7b — REMOVE vestigial code cleanly (Imtiyaz: "why label, just remove it") — AFTER DEMO
Labels were the safe interim (L7). Proper end-goal = delete the dead/unused code. NOT trivial — hidden deps:
- **ATR (`atr20_pct`)** is threaded through: `backtest_replay` predicted-TP scaling (`atr_usd`), `bridge_core.execute()`
  signature, `bridge_data` signal-log + **SQLite DB schema columns**, dashboard. Removing = ~6 files + a schema
  migration + handling the predicted-TP path. (ATR is NOT used in any live decision, only the info-only predicted path.)
- **Dead PBE / partial-close / full-breakeven / smart-exit** in `bridge_risk._update_buy/_sell` — ✅ **DONE
  2026-06-29:** dep-traced (every live VirtualTrade is `ratchet=True`; a non-ratchet trade is skipped at
  `execute()` line 191), then REMOVED `_update_buy`, `_update_sell`, `_smart_exit_check`; `update()` now always
  routes to `_update_ratchet`; trimmed the now-unused imports; `status()` fields kept (used by dashboard).
  Compile-OK, 0 nulls (mount-write corruption hit + stripped). `__init__`/`status` unchanged.
- **ATR (`atr20_pct`) removal — SAFE SUBSET DONE 2026-06-29 (live-neutral); DB/model parts deferred.**
  Established ATR is fully vestigial (dropped from FEATURE_COLS 2026-06-19; every read uses a default constant;
  `execute()`'s `atr20_pct` param was never used; `vol_regime` is "informational only, no filtering").
  REMOVED (behavior-neutral): the per-bar `📐 Live ATR20` display log + `result["atr20_pct"]` threading
  (`bridge_main`), and the unused `atr20_pct` parameter from `execute()` / `handle_opposite_signal()`
  (`bridge_core`). Both Read-verified complete (bash py_compile shows false truncation errors), 0 nulls.
  LEFT IN PLACE deliberately (need a stopped bot): the SQLite `atr20_pct` column (nullable — now logs 0, no
  live-DB migration), `inference.py` `vol_regime` constant, the `df["atr20_pct"]` compute, and
  `train_move_model.py` `atr_usd` (only matters on retrain). Finish these when the bot is stopped.
**How (do AFTER DEMO is stable — not mid-validation):**
- [ ] 4-round dep-trace each item (grep every usage; confirm no live path touches it).
- [ ] Remove + migrate the signal-log/DB schema (drop atr columns or keep nullable) without breaking logging.
- [ ] DEMO re-test the bridge after removal (no exceptions, signals still log, dashboard still renders).
**Why parked:** mid-DEMO removal of live code risks bugs in the running validation; labels are zero-risk for now.
**Status:** parked. **Logged:** 2026-06-28.

### L3 — ML Exit/TP-predictor model (Imtiyaz's idea)
Per-trade personalized TP from entry features, learned from the 13-TP sweep R(TP) curves + `peak_r`.
One-pass simulator → matched R(TP) table → label best TP (regression) → train small → WFO vs regime-TP.
Do only after the simple regime-TP is confirmed live.

### L4 — Fix OPEN bugs (from BUG_LOG.md / GUIDE §5b)
Six high-priority bugs already fixed; these remain open. Fix order:
- [x] **A 🔴 — ✅ DONE (verified 2026-06-29):** secondaries now flattened on EVERY daily-SL/TP halt path,
      guarded to fire ONLY on the fresh False→True transition (sticky flag would otherwise reconnect/close
      every poll): `bridge_main.py:360-365` (check_closed realized-loss halt), `bridge_core.py:369-372`
      (`check_daily_sl_intrabar` ratchet floor, 2s), `bridge_core.py:377-380` (`check_daily_tp_intrabar`).
      Plus all per-trade exits (flip/vSL/TP) already call `close_secondary_accounts()`. No code change needed.
      (Minor residual edge: on RESTART when daily-SL was already breached pre-restart, preload sets the sticky
      flag so no re-flatten — but those secondary trades were already closed when the SL first fired live.)
- [x] **F 🟡 — ✅ DONE (verified 2026-06-29; implemented 2026-06-27):** `backtest_replay.py:243-249` defaults
      `TRAIL_MODE` to the live config — when `--stop-trail` is omitted, uses `"htf"` if `ratchet_htf_sl` else
      `"line"`, so every default backtest/WFO matches live's HTF exit. Includes Bug J entry-SL match (H1 line,
      2.5% cap, lines 486-494) + H1 flip (315, 383-385). No code change needed.
- [x] **B 🟠 — ✅ DONE (found already fixed, verified 2026-07-01):** `bridge_core.py:649-654` — `recover_open_trades()`
      now reconstructs `open_time` from the real open duration (`tick.time − pos.time`), comment tags it
      "Bug B fix". Docs here were stale; code already had the fix.
- [x] **E 🟡 — ✅ DONE (found already fixed, verified 2026-07-01):** `backtest_replay.py:26-27` wraps
      `sys.stdout`/`sys.stderr` in a UTF-8 `TextIOWrapper` — the cp1252 emoji crash is handled. Docs here were stale.
- [ ] C 🟠 set live `SYMBOL` from the connected primary (matters once `MT5_PRIMARIES` failover is used).
      **Still open, confirmed 2026-07-01** — `bridge_constants.py:43` sets `SYMBOL` once at import from
      `MT5_ACCOUNTS[0]`; `connect_primary()` (bridge_multi.py) never updates it after a failover switch.
      Dormant only because `MT5_PRIMARIES` is currently unconfigured (no failover in use).
- [ ] D 🟠 (big refactor) one subprocess per MT5 terminal — root of the multi-account fragility. Later.
- [x] **M 🟠 — ✅ FIXED 2026-07-01:** `engine/run_wfo.py` — `--trail-mode` default was `"line"`, and
      `bt_cmd += ["--stop-trail", args.trail_mode]` only fired `if args.trail_mode != "line"`. Since Bug F
      made `backtest_replay.py` default to a **config-aware** trail (htf when live `ratchet_htf_sl=True`),
      omitting `--stop-trail` no longer meant literal M15-line — it meant "whatever config says" (htf).
      So `run_wfo.py --trail-mode line` (default or typed explicitly) silently ran HTF, not line.
      **Fix applied:** default changed `"line"` → `None`; forward condition changed to
      `if args.trail_mode is not None:`. Now: no flag → `None` → nothing forwarded → `backtest_replay.py`'s
      own config-aware default applies (htf today) — same result as before, now correct-by-design instead
      of accidental. Explicit `--trail-mode line` now genuinely FORCES line mode (previously silently ignored).
      `py_compile` clean. No other reference to `args.trail_mode` elsewhere in the file.
**Detail:** `docs/BUG_LOG.md`. Do C opportunistically; D is a project (see below, Imtiyaz flagged 2026-07-01).
